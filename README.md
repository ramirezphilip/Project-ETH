# Brief Description/Overview: 
Looking at the value of Ethereum in USD over time

In Google Colab, I plotted a graph displaying the value, in USD, of Ethereum over a 5 year gap. In order to make the x-axis less cluttered, I only used 8 dates as a reference for timeline. The csv file started from the current date, so in order to make the graph chronological, I had to invert the graph using a quick .invert_xaxis() function. 

The point of this data is to see the rates of the growth of Ethereum, starting back in 2016. The visualization can help others see a trend of when to buy Ethereum and when to sell.
